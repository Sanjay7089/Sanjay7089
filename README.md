## 👋 Hi, I’m Sanjay

🧩 **Software Engineer — Backend & Platform**  
2+ years of experience building cloud-native backend systems.

I work at the intersection of **backend engineering**, **platform infrastructure**, and **cloud systems**, focusing on reliability, scalability, and clean system design.

---

## 🎯 What I Work On

### 🛠 Backend Engineering
- Designing **REST APIs** with Python & FastAPI  
- Async workflows and concurrency handling  
- Server-side state management  
- Relational data modeling with PostgreSQL  

### ☁️ Platform & Cloud
- Building and operating services on **AWS & GCP**  
- Infrastructure provisioning using **Terraform**  
- Containerized workloads with **Docker & Kubernetes**  
- CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD)  
- Observability: logs, metrics, alerts  

---

## 🧠 How I Learn & Build

I learn backend and platform concepts by **shipping real systems**, not tutorials.

My approach:
- Pick a real problem  
- Design backend-first architecture  
- Deploy to cloud infrastructure  
- Observe real usage and failures  
- Iterate with cost and reliability in mind  

This mirrors how production systems evolve in real teams.

## 🚀 Selected Work

### 🎶 JamVote — Real-time Music Voting System
A backend-heavy project built to practice system design and cloud deployment.

**What this project demonstrates**
- FastAPI backend handling concurrent voting workflows  
- HTTP APIs for commands + WebSockets for real-time state  
- PostgreSQL schema design and query optimization  
- Abuse prevention (duplicate votes, rate limiting)  
- Cloud Run + Cloud SQL deployment on GCP  
- Cost-aware infrastructure decisions
